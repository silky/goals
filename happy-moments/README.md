Nice birthday dinner with Marianne, also good to have some feedback from
supervisors on my thesis.

Really enjoyable dinner with some friends; I cooked and it was a very
fun experience! I learned that cooking for 8 is not really a one-person
job, or at least you need to be really organised.

I had a great morning and really nice hot cross buns. Also was reminded about
playing piano, and was happy to observe that we have one at home!

I also started reading the "I Am A Strange Loop" book, and am excited about
it.

I had a nice morning, deciding to just relax about everything. I worked out
a minor calculation that I'd been stuck on, I realised a nice place to go for
dinner with Jay, and it's sunny and I'm feeling supported and loved. I also got
some books that I like!

Found [this](https://github.com/una/personal-goals), made me think of doing
this stuff myself again.
